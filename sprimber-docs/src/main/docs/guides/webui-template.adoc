= Building Web UI test automation with Sprimber and Selenium

This guide will walk you through process of writing UI Selenium based tests with Sprimber.

== What you will build

You will write tests that checks http://www.griddynamics.com[GridDynamics web page] and generate Allure report after execution.
Tests will be written in Gherkin language and will be executed by Sprimber.
Report will contain all test execution details: steps, page screenshots and stack traces after failures.

== What you need

* 30 minutes of time
* IDE or text editor
* JDK 1.8 or later
* Maven 3+

== How to start

You can either check completed code in *sprimber-examples/sprimber-webui-template* or follow step by step guide.

== Step by step

For all Sprimber applications we need to start with creation of basic package structure, then pom, Spring application with configuration and properties

=== Package structure

To have code organized, we will create 3 packages:

* *configuration* - where all Sprimber configuration will be stored.
Also _Configuration Properties_ classes will be stored here.
* *model* - where all Page models will be stored.
If needed additional packages for each sub page can be created inside.
* *steps* - where all classes with steps implementations will be kept.

Our tests will be kept in *resources/features* folder.

=== Pom file

In pom file, following dependencies needs to be included (please use latest versions):

[source,xml]
----
    <dependencies>
        ...
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.griddynamics.qa</groupId>
            <artifactId>sprimber-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
            <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.assertj</groupId>
            <artifactId>assertj-core</artifactId>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
            <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
        ...
    </dependencies>
----

Following plugins should be included in *build/plugins* sections:

[source,xml]
----
    <plugins>
        ...
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>repackage</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>io.qameta.allure</groupId>
            <artifactId>allure-maven</artifactId>
        </plugin>
        ...
    </plugins>
----

=== Spring application

Sprimber is executed as Spring application, so we need to create one:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class WebUiTemplate {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        SpringApplication.exit(SpringApplication.run(WebUiTemplate.class));
    }
}
----

=== Configuration and properties

Let's define following properties class that will hold webdriver variables:

* path to actual driver binary
* timeout in seconds

[source,java]
----
@ConfigurationProperties("web-driver")
@Data
public class WebDriverProperties {
    private String pathToDriver;
    private Long loadWaitInSeconds;
}
----

Then we can create Spring configuration for Sprimber and actual drivers.
Because Sprimber provides test execution in 3 threads we will limit it to 1 by creating custom Executor bean.
This will allow us to reuse one instance of webdriver between tests.
We will also assume that different drivers can be used, and we will switch between them by profiles.
Below you will find example for FireFox.
Additional driver configuration can be found on https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/driver_requirements/[Selenium: Driver requirements] page

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableConfigurationProperties({WebDriverProperties.class})
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class WebUiTemplateConfiguration {

    private final WebDriverProperties webDriverProperties;

    @Bean
    public Executor testExecutor() {
        ThreadPoolTaskExecutor taskExecutor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
        taskExecutor.setCorePoolSize(1);
        taskExecutor.setMaxPoolSize(1);
        taskExecutor.setThreadNamePrefix("TCExecutor-");
        taskExecutor.initialize();
        return taskExecutor;
    }

    @Bean
    @Profile("firefox")
    public WebDriver firefoxDriver() {
        System.setProperty("webdriver.gecko.driver", webDriverProperties.getPathToDriver());
        WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(new FirefoxOptions());
        driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(webDriverProperties.getLoadWaitInSeconds(), TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        return driver;
    }
}
----

=== Application.yml file

Now it's time to create application.yml file that will store all our configuration options.
By default Sprimber requires only path to feature files but it's a good practice to define logging levels and tag filters.

[source,text]
----
logging:
    level:
        com.griddynamics.qa.sprimber.lifecycle.TestCaseIlluminator: DEBUG
        com.griddynamics.qa.sprimber.engine.executor: DEBUG
        com.griddynamics.qa.sprimber.test.steps: DEBUG
sprimber:
    configuration:
        featurePath: feature/**/*.feature
        summary:
            printer:
                enable: true
        tagFilters:
            - "@smoke or @navigation or @getInTouch"
----

We will also add section for properties we have created for webDriver:

[source,text]
----
web-driver:
    pathToDriver: <UPDATE ME PLEASE WITH REAL PATH TO BINARY>
    loadWaitInSeconds: 10
----

Please note that because we are using profiles to switch between different drivers, it's easy to create *application-firefox.yml* file and overwrite needed properties (like path to driver).

=== Feature files

Now let's create out first test.
We will write simple one that will navigate to sub page and validate if it was successful (by page title name)

[source,text]
----
Feature: WebUI Template suite - Navigation

    @smoke @navigation
    Scenario: Open 'Get in Touch' page and wait for it to load
        Given open main GridDynamics page
        When navigate to 'Get in Touch'
        Then 'Get in Touch' page is opened
----

=== Model implementation

We may create Basic Page model so all actual pages can extend it.
It will contain logic for interaction with webElements (clicking) and method that will check if correct page title is loaded.

[source,java]
----
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public abstract class PageModel {
    private final WebDriver webDriver; private final WebDriverProperties webDriverProperties;

    protected boolean isPageLoaded(String expectedPageTitle) {
        return new WebDriverWait(webDriver, webDriverProperties.getLoadWaitInSeconds())
                .until(ExpectedConditions.titleIs(expectedPageTitle));
    }

    protected void clickBy(By by) {
        WebElement webElement = new WebDriverWait(webDriver, webDriverProperties.getLoadWaitInSeconds())
                .until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(by));
        webElement.click();
    }
}
----

Because in our example http://www.griddynamics.com[GridDynamics web page] have navigation panel visible on all sub pages, we may include navigation logic in basic page model:

[source,java]
----
    private static final String XPATH_BUTTON_GET_IN_TOUCH = "//span[text()='Get in touch']";
    public void navigateToGetInTouch() {
        this.clickBy(By.xpath(XPATH_BUTTON_GET_IN_TOUCH));
    }
----

We will also need our Main page model.
It will have only one unique method - navigateTo that will load main GridDynamics page

[source,java]
----
@Component
public class MainPageModel extends PageModel {

    private final WebDriver webDriver;
    private static final String MAIN_PAGE_URL = "https://www.griddynamics.com/";

    public MainPageModel(WebDriver webDriver, WebDriverProperties webDriverProperties) {
        super(webDriver, webDriverProperties);
        this.webDriver = webDriver;
    }

    public void navigateTo() {
        webDriver.navigate().to(MAIN_PAGE_URL);
    }
}
----

Now let's create Get in Touch sub page model.
It will extend Page Model and provide method that will check if page is successfully loaded:

[source,java]
----
@Component
public class GetInTouchModel extends PageModel {
    private final static String EXPECTED_WINDOW_TITLE = "Contact Us | Grid Dynamics";

    public GetInTouchModel(WebDriver webDriver, WebDriverProperties webDriverProperties) {
        super(webDriver, webDriverProperties);
    }

    public boolean isPageLoaded() {
        return super.isPageLoaded(EXPECTED_WINDOW_TITLE);
    }
}
----

=== Step implementation

Steps for each page and sub page will be kept in separate classes.
We will start from Main page steps.
Please note that for Sprimber to discover steps implementation, _@Action_ annotation needs to be present.

[source,java]
----
@Actions
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class MainPageSteps {
    private final MainPageModel mainPageModel;

    @Given("^open main GridDynamics page$")
    public void loadMainPage() {
        mainPageModel.navigateTo();
    }

    @When("^navigate to 'Get in Touch'$")
    public void navigateToGetInTouch() {
        mainPageModel.navigateToGetInTouch();
    }
}
----

Similarly we will create steps for Get in Touch page.

[source,java]
----
@Actions
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class GetInTouchSteps {
    private final GetInTouchModel getInTouchModel;

    @Then("^'Get in Touch' page is opened$")
    public void getInTouchIsOpened() {
        assertThat(getInTouchModel.isPageLoaded()).isTrue();
    }
}
----

=== Test execution

In order to execute tests, we need to start Sprimber spring application.
For development and local execution it's possible to start tests with spring maven plugin with following command:

....
mvn clean spring-boot:run -Dsprimber.configuration.tagFilters="@failed" -Dspring.profiles.active=firefox
....

To have sealed artifact for test execution it's preferred to build and use the jar.
It can be done with commands:

....
mvn clean install
java -jar /PATH_TO_JAR/JAR_NAME.jar -Dsprimber.configuration.tagFilters="@failed" -Dspring.profiles.active=firefox
....

This way we may be sure that if we rerun tests, we will use the same version.
If the artifacts are stored, it's also easy to to run older versions of tests.
Artifacts are also easily sharable between teams.

=== Allure report generation

Once tests are completed we can generate allure report:

....
mvn allure:serve
....

Report should be opened in new window in default browser.

=== Hooks implementation

If we would like to configure some recurring action that will be executed after each step, test or suite, we may use hook annotations provided by Sprimber.
Let say we want to do screenshot of page after each step and attach it to allure report.
It can be done easily with following code:

[source,java]
----
@Actions
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class Hooks {

    private final AllureLifecycle allureLifecycle;
    private final WebDriver webDriver;

    @AfterStep
    public void attachScreenShot() {
        allureLifecycle.addAttachment("Screenshot after test step", "image/png", "png",
                ((TakesScreenshot) webDriver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.BYTES));
    }
}
----

If tests will be rerun now, in each step in report, additional attachment will be present.

=== Adding failing test and additional hook

Sprimber emits different evens on suite, test and step start, execution and end.
It also emits events in case there are failures.
We may use them to create custom hooks that will be executed if specific conditions are met.
In our example we may want to attach page source to failing step (that later can be used for debugging.) First we may create broken test by removing *When* step from our example feature file:

[source,text]
----
Feature: WebUI Template suite - 'Get in Touch' page

  @getInTouch @failed
  Scenario: Fail if link is not clicked
    Given open main GridDynamics page
    Then 'Get in Touch' page is opened
----

To catch event that is emitted after step failure we can add following method into our *Hooks* (or any other) class:

[source,java]
----
    @EventListener
    public void after(SprimberEventPublisher.TargetNodeErrorEvent errorEvent) {
        allureLifecycle.addAttachment("Page source after failure", "text/plain", "html",
                webDriver.getPageSource().getBytes());
    }
----

Now if our test will be run, failed step will have additional attachment with page source coe.

Different events can checked in *SprimberEventPublisher* class in *sprimber-engine* module.
More information about spring events can be found in https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#context-functionality-events[Spring documentation]

== Summary

Congratulations!
First UI Selenium tests is now completed in Sprimber.
It will produce detailed report with screenshots and additional debug information for failed tests.
In our source code we changed Scenario to Scenario outline in feature file to support additional sub page object to show how easily additional models can be added.
